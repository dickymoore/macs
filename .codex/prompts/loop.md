# Keep Looping

Continue looping and progressing work. Do not reply to me until you are completely blocked and there is no remaining work you can advance.

If blocked on one task, immediately move to other unblocked tasks, reviews, or improvements you can safely progress.

Only interrupt me when every viable path is blocked or you need a decision that cannot be made safely without me.
