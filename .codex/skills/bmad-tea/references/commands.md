- `test-design` -- risk-based test planning (system or per-epic)
- `atdd` -- generate failing acceptance tests (red phase)
- `automate` -- build passing tests after implementation
- `test-review` -- audit test quality and score it
- `nfr-assess` -- assess non-functional requirements
- `trace` -- requirements traceability + gate decision

## Output Expectations
- `framework`: tests/ scaffolding, config files, sample tests
- `ci`: CI workflow files + sharding/burn-in setup
- `test-design`: test design documents
- `atdd`: failing tests + implementation checklist
- `automate`: expanded test suite + updated fixtures
- `test-review`: quality score report
- `nfr-assess`: NFR assessment report
- `trace`: traceability matrix + gate decision
