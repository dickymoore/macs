# Planning Tracks (summary from docs)

## Quick Flow Track
- Use for small, well-scoped changes (bugs, refactors, small features).
- Run `quick-spec` then `quick-dev`.

## BMad Method Track
- Use for products or significant features.
- Requires PRD and architecture before implementation.

## Enterprise Track
- Use for large, compliance-heavy, multi-tenant, or high-risk systems.
- Extends planning with security, DevOps strategy, and test strategy.

## Track Selection
- `/bmad-help` can recommend a track based on complexity indicators.
- Users can override the recommendation.
